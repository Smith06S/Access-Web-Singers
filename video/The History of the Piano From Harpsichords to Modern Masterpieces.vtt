Innovations and transformations to

6
00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:18.439
become the instrument we know today to

7
00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:20.840
truly appreciate the piano we must

8
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.119
travel back to the late Middle Ages

9
00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:25.480
where its roots lie in earlier keyboard

10
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.160
instruments such as the harpsicord clav

11
00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.720
aord and organ these predecessors laid

12
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.200
the groundwork for the piano's

13
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.559
development by introducing the concept

14
00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:38.399
of keys controlling strings or pipes a

15
00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.960
revolutionary idea in its time the organ

16
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.120
in particular was one of the earliest

17
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.199
keyboard instruments dating back to

18
00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:49.160
ancient Greece while it lacked strings

19
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.160
its mechanism of producing sound through

20
00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.680
pipes activated by Keys set the stage

21
00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.399
for more refined keyboard instruments

22
00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.920
welcome to the history of simple things

23
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.680
where we delve into the fascinating

24
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.320
history behind the little things that

25
00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.920
shape our

26
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.400
world the clava cord and harpsicord

27
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.320
emerged during the late Renaissance and

28
00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.159
Baroque periods adding strings into the

29
00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.479
equation the clav aord allowed for

30
00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:24.400
subtle Dynamic changes based on the

31
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.479
player's touch but its sound was

32
00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.040
relatively quiet making it unsuitable

33
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.280
for large performance performances the

34
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.079
harpsicord on the other hand could

35
00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:35.200
project louder but its strings were

36
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.600
plucked rather than struck limiting its

37
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.840
ability to produce variations in

38
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.560
Dynamics these limitations inspired

39
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.079
inventors to seek a solution an

40
00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:46.799
instrument that could combine the

41
00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.079
expressive dynamics of the clav cord

42
00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.399
with the projection of the harpsicord

43
00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:53.280
this pursuit of perfection led to the

44
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.719
invention of the piano an instrument

45
00:01:55.719 --> 00:02:00.240
that would revolutionize music forever

46
00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:04.759
the piano as we know it was invented in

47
00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:08.038
Italy by bartomeo christophori around

48
00:02:08.038 --> 00:02:11.200
1700 christofori a Harps Accord maker

49
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.800
employed by the medich family in

50
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.879
Florence sought to create a keyboard

51
00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:17.800
instrument capable of dynamic expression

52
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.440
his breakthrough was the invention of

53
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.640
the hammer mechanism which struck the

54
00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.640
strings rather than plucking them

55
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.680
allowing for variations in volume

56
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.440
depending on the force applied to the

57
00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.319
Keys initially called the raiso Cole

58
00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:34.200
piano a forte meaning Harps Accord with

59
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.800
soft and Loud Christo for's creation

60
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.319
introduced the ability to play both soft

61
00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:42.640
piano and Loud Forte hence the name

62
00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.200
piano Forte while christop for's

63
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.319
invention was groundbreaking it took

64
00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:49.480
time for the piano to gain widespread

65
00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.319
popularity early pianos were expensive

66
00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.080
and lacked the refinement of modern

67
00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.760
instruments but they caught the

68
00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.319
attention of musicians and composers who

69
00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.840
recognized their potential

70
00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.519
by the mid 18th century the piano began

71
00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.920
to evolve thanks in large part to the

72
00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.599
contributions of Craftsmen and composers

73
00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:15.640
instrument makers in Germany such as

74
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.799
godfried Silberman improved upon

75
00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:19.959
Christopher's design by adding features

76
00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.480
like a damper pedal to sustain notes and

77
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.959
expanding the range of keys these

78
00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.599
Innovations made the piano more

79
00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:29.040
versatile and appealing to composers

80
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.439
around the same time composers like Carl

81
00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:33.959
Philip Emanuel Bach started writing

82
00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.120
music specifically for the piano

83
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.720
showcasing its expressive capabilities

84
00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.439
and helping to cement its place in the

85
00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:43.280
world of Music the piano quickly became

86
00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.439
a symbol of musical progress and

87
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.360
sophistication The Classical period

88
00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.879
spanning the late 18th to early 19th

89
00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:58.079
century saw the piano's rise to

90
00:03:58.079 --> 00:03:59.959
prominence as the instrument of of

91
00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:01.920
choice for many of the era's greatest

92
00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.519
composers including Wolf Gang Amadeus

93
00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:07.360
Mozart Ludwig van Beethoven and France

94
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.720
Joseph heyen during this time the piano

95
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.040
underwent significant improvements such

96
00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.200
as the introduction of the sustain pedal

97
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.560
a more robust frame and an expanded

98
00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.120
keyboard range these enhancements

99
00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.280
allowed composers to experiment with new

100
00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.759
musical ideas leading to some of the

101
00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:27.440
most iconic Piano Works in history

102
00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.800
Beethoven in particular pushed the

103
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.960
boundaries of piano composition

104
00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.639
demanding more from the instrument's

105
00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:37.120
range and dynamic capabilities his Works

106
00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.280
inspired further Innovations in piano

107
00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.520
construction as instrument makers sought

108
00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.479
to meet the demands of increasingly

109
00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:46.080

111
00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.240
19th century marked a turning point in

112
00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.800
the history of the piano advances in

113
00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.400
Metallurgy and Manufacturing techniques

114
00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.240
and enabled the production of stronger

115
00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.960
frames allowing posos to handle higher

116
00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.080
string tensions and produce a more

117
00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.880
powerful sound the introduction of iron

118
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.960
frames and felt covered hammers

119
00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.080
significantly improved the instrument's

120
00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.960
durability and tonal quality these

121
00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.240
changes coincided with the romantic era

122
00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.520
in music a time when composers like

123
00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.360

135
00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.479
pianos made the instrument more

136
00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:57.639
accessible to middleclass families

137
00:05:57.639 --> 00:05:59.440
leading to its widespread presence in
